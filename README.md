## Description

GreenWatch is a web-based platform that fosters on accountable reforestation and restoration activities by groups that carry out tree-planting initiatives. More often than not, the number of trees planted is not the same number of trees that go past early growth because of negligence.The early growth stages of trees is the most crucial stage but we always put tree seedlings into the ground and leave the rest for mother nature to take care of. We have always concentrated on HOW MANY TREES WE PLANT and its now time to shift to HOW MANY OF THOSE TREES, PLANTED, REACH MATURITY.

GreenWatch offers a platform to monitor on the activities of groups running out tree-planting programs, be it learning institutions, NGOs, government institutions, factories, companies, social groups etc. All citizens get to visualize the summarized details also on the platform. We don't exclude individuals who also wish to be sole participants towards greening our future. GreenWatch also gives individuals an opportunity to plant trees and their efforts be rewarded. Through affiliate marketing, we strive to strike a balance between consumption and production, where we look to market for businesses and a tree is planted for every product that is bought through GreenWatch.
