                <p >Join us in being accountable for every tree being planted in our quest to combat climate change.
                   Tree planting process is the easiest step in this journey of reforestation but maintainance to see those trees through to maturity until
                   we achieve the set forest coverage, is our biggest hurdle. Our focus must shift from <i>" how many trees we plant today "</i> to 
                   <i>" how many of those trees survive tomorrow "</i>. See our latest updates on tree planting activities by various groups in Kenya, 
                   our approach in bringing businesses and individuals on board through marketing and how we connect farmers with institutions, companies and organizations that need tree seedlings and maintainance services.</p>

                  It is only if the trees we plant reach maturity, then are we going to achieve our main goal of increasing our forest coverage. More often than not, out of all those trees planted
                  only less than half manage to survive and this is ends up becoming a huge setback towards our goal. This happens due to our negligence after tree planting activity and the planted trees are left
                  to the mercies and grace of nature for survival. We give this platform to the various groups in tree planting to register and record on their activities by visualizing the progress they make.

                  GreenLead also offers the groups an opportunity to participate in the carbon market by selling carbon credits they have generated from the carbon sequestered by the trees they have planted.
                  This provides financial incentives for their reforestation activities. by selling carbon credits, project developers can generate revenue that can be reinvested in sustaining and expanding
                  their reforestation efforts. Learn more about Verified Carbon Standards,carbon sequestration, carbon footprint asssesment and carbon market participation by joining us.
